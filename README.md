# TOP Calculator
The final Javascript assignment of The Odin Project foundation course. I will be creating a basic in-browser calculator.

LE: Since the build was a calculator, I tried styling it like the iOS Calculator which I use on an almost daily basis.

I was really happy and surprised myself with getting it going in quite a short while. I was nervous when I started the project and didn't really know where to begin. It did take me a while to sort out some particularities and some errors I was getting, however I managed to fix them.

The calculator is definitely limited in its functions, however I might be reviewing it at a later point in my coding progress.

As per the TOP requirements, it can do one operation at a time.

Upgrades to-do:

add the possibility of calculating multiples of numbers when pressing on the same operator multiple times (eg: 2 + 2 = 4 + (prints 6) + (prints 8) etc)
more interesting UI
make result stick (it currently only works for "+" and "-") when user presses "*" or "/" multiple times after they get a result. doing so currently throws an error.
